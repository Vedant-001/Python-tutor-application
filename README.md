# Python-tutor-application
This Repository consists of a code to develop an application which includes basic text based information of Python and its functionalities and usage.
This code will work on all the systems compatible with PyCharm and/or Python and have the kivy package installed. 
This code makes use of the kivy (.kv) package available in python.

## How to run? ##
